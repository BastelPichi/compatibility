# STLink on Android
Requirements: An Android Smartphone, USB OTG Adapter, ST-Link.  
  
Note: You need to understand the fundamental principles of ST-Linking.  
   
1) Start by installing the [Scooterhacking Utility](https://utility.cfw.sh/). You will need to have Chrome installed.  
   
2) Open SHU (Scooterhacking Utility) and take a note of the MCU you have (AT32, GD32, STM32). Note your Odometer value (in km), and your SN. 
3) Go to the [Webflasher](https://flash.bastelpichi.de). Choose your Scooter, enter the odometer value in km, enter your SN.  
5) Click "Start Flashing". Select the ST-Link, and wait for the flashing to complete. If you press "Start Countdown" flashing will start 15 seconds later, so you have both hands to hold your wires.
  
6) Congrats, your controller should now be flashed!
