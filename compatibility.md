# SHU/SHFW Compatibility

SHU stands for Scooterhacking Utility. SHU Support means you can use the app, and allows things like changing Serial/Regen. **but doesnt necessarily mean you can tune the scooter.**  
SHFW stands for Scooterhacking Firmware. It means you can unlock the full potential of your scooter, with the ability of e.g. custom profile triggers, field weakening etc.  
  
If the scooter isn't on the list, its not supported.
