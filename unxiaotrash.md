# Removing XiaoDash from your Scooter
Xiaodash prevents you from flashing firmware via other apps or via ST-Link. This tutorial shows you how to do it nonetheless.

## For Ninebot G2/F2/F65
We need an ST-Link - you likely ST-Linked your controller before installing XiaoDash.
1) Open XiaoDash. Connect to your Scooter. In General Tab, go to Debug and click on "Enter Bootloader Mode".
2) Go to [https://flash.bastelpichi.de](https://flash.bastelpichi.de) and hook up the ST-Link. You should be familiar from there.

## For other Scooters
Go to XiaoDash, connect to your Scooter. Open the Basic Tab, click on Return to Stock. After that, you can flash SHFW via Bluetooth.
