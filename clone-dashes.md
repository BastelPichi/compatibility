# Clone Dashes

- Clone dashes usually come with chinese FW
- Chinese FWs often suck
- With _some_ dashboards you can flash SHFW to your scooter, with _some_ you cant.
- Chinese FW might self destruct the dashboard
<br>

- Clone dashes usually run the N51802x
- You _can_ flash the N51802x with Reflasher, MiDu-Flasher, m365-rescue or scooterflasher
- Since the Hardware is almost identical, stock FW usually works
- If the dashboard is flashed, the behaviour described above will be fixed
- Usually the only thing thats off after the flashing is the Buzzer, which sounds worse.
